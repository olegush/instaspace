# Space Instagram

[TODO: here would be project description]


### How to install

[TODO: tell user where he should get keys, where they should be and how they look like]

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Quickstart

First script, the **fetch_spacex.py** fetches photos of the latest launch of [SpaceX program](https://www.spacex.com/). The second, **fetch_hubble.py** fetches photos of [The Hubble Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/), collection "news". And the third, **upload_to_instagram.py** prepares and publishes photos to Instagram account.


### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
